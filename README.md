# connect-pug-static
Connect (ExpressJS) middleware for serving html files from Pug (former Jade) template

It's loosely based on [runk/connect-jade-static](https://github.com/runk/connect-jade-static) package, but updated to use Pug naming instead of Jade (ref. issue [#2184](https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2184) and few improvements.
